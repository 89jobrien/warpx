# Verification Before Completion

**Rule**: Evidence before claims, always. No completion claim without fresh verification output.

"NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE."

## The Five-Step Gate

Before saying any task is done:

1. **Identify** the verification command
2. **Execute** it fully — not a partial check, not a cached result
3. **Read** the complete output and exit code
4. **Verify** the output matches your claim
5. **Then and only then** make the assertion

## Rust Verification Sequence

```bash
cargo nextest run -p <crate>              # all tests green
cargo clippy -p <crate> -- -D warnings   # zero warnings
cargo fmt --check                         # no formatting diff
git log --oneline -3                      # commits present
```

For workspace-level completion:

```bash
cargo nextest run --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
```

## Red Flags — You Are About to Lie

- "Should work" → run it and check
- "Probably passes" → run it and check
- "Tests were passing earlier" → run them now
- "I fixed the issue" → verify the fix is in and tests pass
- "Looks good" → evidence or it didn't happen

## Subagent Reports

Never trust a subagent's self-report without independent verification. Run the verification
commands yourself after a subagent claims completion.

```bash
git log --oneline -5   # empty list = subagent did not finish
```
